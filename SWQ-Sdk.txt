STAR WARS QUAKE - Software Developers' Kit
=============================================

Continued interest in Quake 2 editing has
prompted me to assemble this pack for those
looking to continue with a Q2 mod who might
also happen to need content. The conditions
of use and distribution are described below:


USE AND DISTRIBUTION:
This pack is designed for those looking to continue the SWQ project or a
derivative mod. It contains textures, code source, and map files (most compiled)
which can be redistributed in another mod. However credit must be given if any
part of this SDK is used, even bits of code or modified textures. The
environment textures were created for SWQ by a professional developer, Maxer I
believe - can't confirm, so I ask that you respect the sky maps and use them in
an unmodified form. Of course none of this material can be used or destributed
for profit.

DEVELOPERS LOOKING TO CONTINUE SWQ or DERIVATIVE PROJECTS:
To ensure you get all our content download all the packs (md2, wav, txt, and
sdk) as well as the original DM release.
1) Install DM release into an new directory (like SWQ_SDK) and unpack the pak0
2) Extract the md2, wav, txt, and sdk packs into this new directory in any order
*Overwrite anything originally extracted from the pak0.pak
*SDK pack is large because it includes all the textures, maps, and code source
*Due to the number of level designers who have come and gone there may be
compiled maps (.bsp) with no accompanying .map or .qrk files, it is rare in fact
to find any source files for our incomplete maps; part of the reason we never
completed this project =/
*If you have quality maps you'd like to see included in the pack, or an official
SWQ level pack then e-mail and active member of the team with a link to where we
can download your map -- no attachments please.

Notes from SWQ team
-----------------------------------
"I hope this doesn't look as crappy as I feel making it" -- FuShanks, 2D Artist
"If only I played less Team Fortress Classic" -- Privateer, 3D Artist *snicker*
"Hurry before reality catches up with them..." -- RipVTide, Coder
"Great job Priv!" -- Red Knight, Project Leader (he actually typed it, once)

Maps
-----------------------------------
Most of these have no source files, part of the reason development was never
finished, so consider them reference material. You'll note in the documents
directory is thedoc.html, this is Red Knight's original design document. It
describes the original plan for our maps and should explain the purpose for the
various env maps. It was last updated in October of 1999 and our plans had long
been scaled back, also Priv had some other ideas in mind for a few of the
models.

Bugs
-----------------------------------
The SWQ code is full of bugs, most prominant are a few show-stoppers and the
animation code. Saber swinging animations need to be reworked so they have
higher priority (the legs are animated to correspond with movement direction).
Falling and special effects are another area in need of reworking, the choke
and lightning effects were supposed to inflict choke_pain and light_pain in the
player models and not a generic pain animation.
Monster code was in the process of being reworked to take advantage of the new
player models when work was halted. See Players\players.txt from the model pack
for further instructions on their intended use.

SWQ Releases
-----------------------------------
Deathmatch Release 1
Model Pack
Sound Pack (including music in mp3 and wav)
Texture Pack (DM1 contains most of these)
